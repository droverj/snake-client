# Snake Client Project

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en).

The snake game, found in hundreds of variations since its first release, has been enjoyed by many for decades. The object of the game is to grow your snake as large as possible by targetting the markers within the server window. You lose when you either collide with yourself or with a wall. As you grow, you will evolve into your own obstacle.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can clone from [here](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer).

```Use npm to install and run play.```

Use command keys **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** to move left, right, up or down.

Use command keys **E**, **R**, and **F** to display messages as you play.
